## About

Coder Zone is a after-school program through LivingWorks that teaches basic web development skills to Chicago Public School children in the Rogers Park neighborhood. Students ranging from fourth through eighth grade meet weekly to gain hands-on coding experience with real software engineers and web developers. The goal of this program is to introduce these technologies as a potential career choice for students, as well as break down the cultural, racial, and gender barriers that currently exist in the industry.

## This Repo

We're introducing middle schoolers to JavaScript through the P5 library. Every week, they're given some code that introduces a concept. Along with a presentation and pairing with a volunteer, they explore how the code works and the principles behind it and then are encouraged to modify the example code or build something new using that week's lessons.
